Regardless of what type of design consultancy you would need, first, we suggest you order our In House Design Consultancy service so that we can establish a reference point and we could develop a good understanding of your needs, Alternatively you might consider ordering Preliminary Design Consultancy Service if you have no idea where to start, this is a managed service for design consultancy; i.e. the consultancy for design consultancy.
