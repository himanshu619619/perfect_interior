                    <p class="mt-25">Directory listings and physical instructions are still the information needed to be included in the design, but physical features can now be married to digital aesthetics. Digitally infused space has more function, and architectural designers are incorporating digital facility flying signage into various facility facilities to increase flow and functionality.


                       </p> <p> <strong> Restaurants: </strong>Menu boards have evolved beyond the traditional, static presentations, such as directories, and today's digital menus come with all the bells and whistles you'd expect â€” interactive displays, real-time customization, and even That TV too. Remember when McDonald's Test launched a dedicated in-store television channel (McDonald's Channel) in 2011 to try and connect directly with customers through its digital signage?

                         
                          
                           


                       

                </p> <p>
                  <strong>  Office:</strong> Corporate directories have come a long way from the days of on-the-wall display cases, and today's digital directory design takes full advantage of advanced capabilities.
                    
                     </p> <p>
                         <strong>  Hotels: </strong>Map and brochure kiosk staples found in many hotels are quickly replaced by digital signage solutions that do traditional kiosks and more. Room facilities, hotel facilities, eateries located in the immediate area and entertainment around the city and state can be easily integrated and updated using digital signage.
                          </p> <p>
                   
 <strong> Schools:</strong> The dynamic nature of digital signage presents diverse solutions to communication challenges on school campuses. Complexes of all shapes and sizes are a mix of the many industries listed above - hospitality, food, corporate - making them the perfect place for a wide spectrum of digital signage solutions.

                     </p> <p>
                         Weather information, local and international news, emergency alerts, marketing messages, traffic updates, and even social media posts can be displayed alongside digital directories regardless of building, business, or brand. It is important to consider digital during the design phase when building a new building or making changes to an existing facility as it adds a truly invaluable element to space.
