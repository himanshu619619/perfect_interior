                    Home Theatre </h1>
                    <p class="mt-25">Home theater is commonly defined as an audio and video equipment set up in your home that emulates the movie theater experience. In fact, a good home theater setup may actually provide a more impressive experience that many of those small multiplex cinema screens.

                       
                         
                           
                            <p>By borrowing from both the image and sound technology of the movie theater and adapting it to the home environment, TV and audio manufacturers have provided the consumer the ability to actually approximate the movie theater experience at home, based on the equipment and content access options chosen.

</p>
the application of home theater is intended to provide the consumer with an entertainment option that is suitable for watching TV and movies at home with a little extra excitement than you normally get just watching a plain-old TV by itself.

                       

                    </p>
