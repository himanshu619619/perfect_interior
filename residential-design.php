                    <p class="mt-25">Today, Residential design is a process that results in a new home. All Architectural clients
may have confusion about the term because it represents several stages of the home design
process. The process of residential design includes a contract that specifies details about the
perfect interior design, construction, and pricing obligations. Homeowners who plan to
negotiate with an architectural firm can benefit from exploring concepts related to
residential design before residential design meetings begin.
                        <br><br>Moving to a new home is definitely a life-changing decision that presents new
opportunities, new experiences and certainly new challenges. Many factors come into play
when you are planning a residential move and you need to think of them carefully before
making a final decision. Below are some important things that you need to research and
consider before moving to a new place.

                           Michael Malone, author of &quot;Architects&#39; Guide to Residential Design&quot;, says that regular
meetings with customers are unusual when building construction documents for new home
construction. Architects reduce customer contact during this part of the residential design
process due to the technical nature of construction documents. </p>

<p><strong>Parking space:</strong> If you have a car or any other vehicle, this is also an important aspect. You
definitely need a parking space.</p>
<p><strong>Utilities:</strong>  you are a health-freak; you need to check whether your new house has facilities
like a gym, water pool, and good playground, etc. so that you do not have to waste the time
of day to travel to these facilities. Had to do.</p>

                          It is commonly understood that customers are not required to participate during the
manufacturing process. However, architectural clients can benefit from reviewing final
kitchens and bathroom layouts by inspecting cases such as cabinet organization. A customer
may wish to increase participation during this phase of home design. The residential design
process involves negotiating and bidding on the contents of the house. </p>
<p>Talented architects offer customers their assistance during the construction of the new
home. The residential design process can extend beyond the scope of traditional
architecture and into matters related to landscape, interior design, and pool or water
features.</p>

        <p><strong>Importance </strong>Once an owner outlines his or her needs, a residential design project begins.
The creative activity is considered to be the first phase of residential design behind fulfilling
the wishes of architectural customers. The result of this effort is a home design plan, which
will have drawings and informative details such as essential building materials, fixtures,
appliances, hardware, doors, and windows. This initial stage is sophisticated until
construction documents can develop from the approved plan.</p>
